modeling option dying and premium decay, you’re essentially trying to predict time‑decay behavior (theta‑style erosion) and probability of expiring worthless, not price. For BSE‑style options, LightGBM is still the most compatible choice, but the way you frame the target matters more than the algorithm.

What you should actually predict
For “option dying / premium decay”, don’t regress raw premium; instead:

Regression targets:

premium_decay_rate over next N minutes/days (e.g., (premium_t - premium_t+1) / premium_t).

time_to_zero (how many bars until premium effectively dies, e.g., < 0.5× lot size).

Classification targets:

expires_worthless (1/0) based on strike, time‑to‑expiry, IV, and underlying path.

high_decay_regime (1/0): when theta‑style erosion dominates over gamma/vega.

LightGBM handles both regression and classification very well and is fast enough to retrain as time‑to‑expiry shrinks and volatility regimes shift.

Why LightGBM fits this better than XGBoost
Fast retraining as expiry approaches: As options get closer to expiry, the decay curve becomes steeper and non‑linear; LightGBM’s leaf‑wise growth adapts quickly to these changing regimes.

Handles high‑dimensional feature sets: You can feed in:

Time‑to‑expiry buckets.

Moneyness (ITM/ATM/OTM).

Implied volatility and historical volatility.

Skew and term structure.

Volume / OI.
LightGBM’s histogram‑based algorithm and categorical‑feature handling are efficient for this kind of structure.

When XGBoost still makes sense
Calibrating decay models: If you’re building a “theta‑corrector” on top of a BSM‑style model (e.g., predicting residual error in theoretical theta vs realized decay), XGBoost’s stability and strong regularization help avoid overfitting to noisy decay paths.
​

Small or noisy datasets: If you have limited historical BSE‑options data for a given strike/expiry, XGBoost’s level‑wise growth is more conservative and less prone to chasing noise in the decay curve.

Straight‑up setup for BSE options
Primary model: LightGBM for:

Predicting premium_decay_rate or expires_worthless per strike/expiry.

Flagging “high‑decay / low‑gamma” zones where options are most likely to die.

Secondary model: XGBoost for:

Correcting theoretical decay (e.g., BSM theta vs realized).

Ensemble‑style blending with LightGBM outputs.

If you tell me:

whether you’re using index options (Nifty/Bank Nifty) or stock options,

your timeframe (1‑min, 5‑min, daily), and

whether you want continuous decay rate or binary “dying soon”,

I’ll give you exact target‑labeling logic and a minimal feature set you can plug into LightGBM for BSE‑options.
