This is a hard stop.
No trades, adjustments, rollovers, or explanations after January 31, 2026.

You have full control over:
	•	Position sizing
	•	Risk per trade
	•	Mandatory stop-loss for every trade
	•	Target levels (T1, T2, trailing if needed)
	•	Strike and expiry selection

Every trade must be based on:
	•	Clear technical structure
	•	Predefined risk–reward (minimum 1:2)
	•	Execution logic, not market narratives

Overtrading is forbidden.
Staying flat is a valid and often correct decision.

I will provide daily SENSEX price action and option-chain context.
You must decide whether to:
	•	Enter a trade
	•	Manage an open trade
	•	Stay flat

You are competing against another AI under identical rules.
The only metric that matters is final capital on Jan 31, 2026.
